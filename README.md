# Projects

## Pix3lone

This project is based for individuals who are interested to learn Microcontroller Programming.
This PCB design and built in Maldives for our market.

There are many great README templates available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

```
void sendSensorValues()
{
  unsigned int sensorValues[6], readings[5];
  byte sensorIndex;

  for (sensorIndex = 0; sensorIndex < 6; sensorIndex++) //for analog sensors, calculate the median of 5 sensor readings in order to avoid variability and power surges
  {
    for (byte p = 0; p < 5; p++)
      readings[p] = analogRead(sensorIndex);
    insertionSort(readings, 5); //sort readings
    sensorValues[sensorIndex] = readings[2]; //select median reading
  }

  //send analog sensor values
  for (sensorIndex = 0; sensorIndex < 6; sensorIndex++)
    ScratchBoardSensorReport(sensorIndex, sensorValues[sensorIndex]);

  //send digital sensor values
  ScratchBoardSensorReport(6, digitalRead(2)?1023:0);
  ScratchBoardSensorReport(10, digitalRead(3)?1023:0);
}
